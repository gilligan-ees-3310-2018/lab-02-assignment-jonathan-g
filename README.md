In lab, we will work through `Lab_02_data_exercises.Rmd`, which has exercises
for downloading climate data from the internet and using various tools from the
`tidyverse` package to manipulate the data, analyze it, and plot it.

## Instructions:

* Clone a local copy of the file repository from github.
* In your local repository, answer the exercises in the templates
  `Lab_02_data_exercises.Rmd`.
* When you are done, knit your `.Rmd` files into PDF files.
* Use git to commit your changes (including the edits to the `.Rmd` files
  and the new PDF files) to your local git repository.
* Push the changes from your local git repository to github.

    The last changes that you push before the due date (9:00 AM on Friday 
    Sept. 8) will be graded.

I advise using git to commit changes frequently as you work and push those commits
to github.
